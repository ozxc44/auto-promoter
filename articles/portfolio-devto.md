> Sharing my journey building developer tools, automation scripts, and SaaS utilities. All free, all open source.

## Why I Build in Public

I believe the best way to learn is to build and share. Over the past few months, I've been creating tools that solve actual problems I encountered. Today, I'm sharing 7 projects that might help you too.
